# push_swap
Project for 42_Roma

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.

# INFO

Using Bubble sort to order the stack, then simplify the numbers, assigning an index to each element of the stack.
Now order the stack using the indices, instead of the real numbers, using Radix sort.
Note that under 6 elements , the program uses a different approach and not the Radix, because it goes over the maximum number of instrtuctions permitted.
